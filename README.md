A service applying for criminal legal aid

## Architectural decision records

ADRs are in the `./docs/architectural-decisions/` folder will hold markdown documents that record Architectural decision records (ARDs) for the LAA Apply for Criminal Legal Aid application.

Please install [ADRs Tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) (`brew install adr-tools`) to help manage the creation of new ADR documents.

### To create a new ADR

After installing ADR tools use:

```
adr new <your ADR title>
```

This will initialise new blank ADR with your title as a heading and increment the ARD prefix to the correct number on the ARDs file name.

### Further info

For information on what ARDs are see [here](https://adr.github.io/).
